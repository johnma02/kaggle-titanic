Typically, titles such as Dr. or Sir. were reserved for higher class members of society. We will take advantage of the fact that our data set contains titles, and create a new input feature named \"Title.\" Luckily, this will only involve some quick globbing, as the titles all end with periods."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"id":"7999b25b","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-18T04:30:59.646383Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-18T04:30:59.644567Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-18T04:30:59.679006Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-18T04:30:59.678041Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.05512,"end_time":"2022-07-18T04:30:59.681262","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-07-18T04:30:59.626142","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th>Sex</th>\n","      <th>female</th>\n","      <th>male</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Title</th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Capt</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Col</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Countess</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Don</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Dr</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Jonkheer</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Lady</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Major</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Master</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>40</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Miss</th>\n","      <td>182</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Mlle</th>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Mme</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Mr</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>517</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Mrs</th>\n","      <td>125</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Ms</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Rev</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Sir</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["Sex       female  male\n","Title                 \n","Capt           0     1\n","Col            0     2\n","Countess       1     0\n","Don            0     1\n","Dr             1     6\n","Jonkheer       0     1\n","Lady           1     0\n","Major          0     2\n","Master         0    40\n","Miss         182     0\n","Mlle           2     0\n","Mme            1     0\n","Mr             0   517\n","Mrs          125     0\n","Ms             1     0\n","Rev            0     6\n","Sir            0     1"]},"execution_count":11,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["for i in combined:\n","    i[\"Title\"] = i[\"Name\"].str.extract(' ([A-Za-z]+)\\.', expand=False)\n","pd.crosstab(train_df[\"Title\"], train_df[\"Sex\"])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cc228718","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.017766,"end_time":"2022-07-18T04:30:59.716743","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-07-18T04:30:59.698977","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["We can immediately see that the majority of these titles fall under commoner titles (Miss., Mr., Mrs., etc.), and we have a good number of ~~Jedi~~ \"Masters\" aboard the Titanic.
