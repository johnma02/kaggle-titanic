Feature Engineering\n","\n","### Motivation:\n","During the early 20th century, certain titles were a rare commodity amongst commmon folk. Typically, titles such as Dr. or Sir. were reserved for higher class members of society. We will take advantage of the fact that our data set contains names which include titles if a passenger had one, and create a new input feature named \"Title.\" Luckily, this will only take a small amount of globbing, as the titles typically ended with a period."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"id":"cf258c11","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-14T21:26:06.507176Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-14T21:26:06.50658Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-14T21:26:06.538065Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-14T21:26:06.537291Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.040564,"end_time":"2022-07-14T21:26:06.539718","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-07-14T21:26:06.499154","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th>Sex</th>\n","      <th>female</th>\n","      <th>male</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Title</th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Capt</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Col</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Countess</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Don</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Dr</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Jonkheer</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Lady</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Major</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Master</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>40</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Miss</th>\n","      <td>182</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Mlle</th>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Mme</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Mr</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>517</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Mrs</th>\n","      <td>125</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Ms</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Rev</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Sir</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["Sex       female  male\n","Title                 \n","Capt           0     1\n","Col            0     2\n","Countess       1     0\n","Don            0     1\n","Dr             1     6\n","Jonkheer       0     1\n","Lady           1     0\n","Major          0     2\n","Master         0    40\n","Miss         182     0\n","Mlle           2     0\n","Mme            1     0\n","Mr             0   517\n","Mrs          125     0\n","Ms             1     0\n","Rev            0     6\n","Sir            0     1"]},"execution_count":12,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["for i in combine:\n","    i[\"Title\"] = i.Name.str.extract(' ([A-Za-z]+)\\.', expand=False)\n","pd.crosstab(train_df[\"Title\"], train_df[\"Sex\"])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"56ec256e","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.006094,"end_time":"2022-07-14T21:26:06.552103","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-07-14T21:26:06.546009","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["We will go ahead and group together the rarer titles in a category called \"Exotic\".
