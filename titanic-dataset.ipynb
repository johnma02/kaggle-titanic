I played around a lot with the hyperparameters, to no avail. I fiddled around with my math, and had to debug many errors such as division by zero due to floating point accuracy, or my code generally not behaving as expected. But I had a lot of fun with this notebook. \n","\n","#### Inspirations and sources\n","Of course, this neural network model is inspired by [Andrew Ng's Coursera Course on Deep Learning and Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning).\n","\n","As for feature engineering, I deferred to [Mr. Manav Sehgal's notebook on this data set](https://www.kaggle.com/code/startupsci/titanic-data-science-solutions/notebook), which provided much needed guidance throughout this journey.\n","\n","**-- Thank you for reading my notebook --**"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.12"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":445.392058,"end_time":"2022-07-18T23:35:03.274203","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2022-07-18T23:27:37.882145","version":"2.3.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
